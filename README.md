# eLTER-RI_RDF
Here we archive the documentation to transform information about eLTER-RI entities from JSON (and a bit of HTML scraping) to RDF.

"\<entity\>.json" files are copies of [DEIMS-SDR](https://deims.org) documents obtained through [API](https://deims.org/api).

"mapping_\<entity\>2RDF.md" contain tables with the mapping of JSON documents into RDF representation.

"\<entity\>_RDF.ttl" contain the RDF representation of the trasformations.

To test jsonpath with functions try https://jsonpath.herokuapp.com/
